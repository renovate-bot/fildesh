# Notes.
# - `splice` is `cat` that interprets literal string content between the slashes.
# - `delimend` reads delimited strings until it hits a terminating case.
#   - Equivalent commands:
#     - delimend "\n" "1"
#     - sed --line-buffered -e '/^1$/q'
# - `replace_string` replaces instances of the first stringg with the second one.
#   - Equivalent commands:
#     - replace_string "\n" " "
#     - tr '\n' ' '
